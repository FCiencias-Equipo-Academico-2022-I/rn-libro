abstract="Deep hierarchical structure with multiple layers of hidden space in human speech is intrinsically connected to its dynamic characteristics manifested in all levels of speech production and perception. The desire and an attempt to capitalize on a (superficial) understanding of this deep speech structure helped ignite the recent surge of interest in the deep learning approach to speech recognition and related applications, and a more thorough understanding of the deep structure of speech dynamics and the related computational representations is expected to further advance the research progress in speech technology. In this chapter, we first survey a series of studies on representing speech in a hidden space using dynamic systems and recurrent neural networks, emphasizing different ways of learning the model parameters and subsequently the hidden feature representations of time-varying speech data. We analyze and summarize this rich set of deep, dynamic speech models into two major categories: (1) top-down, generative models adopting localist representations of speech classes and features in the hidden space; and (2) bottom-up, discriminative models adopting distributed representations. With detailed examinations of and comparisons between these two types of models, we focus on the localist versus distributed representations as their respective hallmarks and defining characteristics. Future directions are discussed and analyzed about potential strategies to leverage the strengths of both the localist and distributed representations while overcoming their respective weaknesses, beyond blind integration of the two by using the generative model to pre-train the discriminative one as a popular method of training deep neural networks.",
